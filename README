=============================

This is a small core Java project that uses some of Java's features and some OOP designs. FileProcessor essentially filters and orders a directory of files to a specific demand supplied by a filter file. 
This project receives in the arguments of main a path to a source directory with the files that need to be processed and a path to a filter file. The files name will be printed in console along with warnings or errors. 

=============================
